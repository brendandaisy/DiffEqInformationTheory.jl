using MonteCarloMeasurements, Distributions

## Test/ask for support if necessary for product_distribution's with particle parameters
## Currently, Distribution with particles for parameters works in some cases,
## but maybe not good way to do with indep. observations, i.e. product_distribution
## not immediately obvious how this should work

## Convienience "closed form" logpdfs to send particles through
